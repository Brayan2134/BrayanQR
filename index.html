        <h1 class="mt-5">Hello And Welcome!</h1>
        <p class="lead">My name's Brayan Quevedo Ramos and this is my website!
          It has everything that you would need, from work to personal, social media to meetings-in other words, this website is my online presence.
          The top of the heading is very annoying, I know, and i'm working on it!

        <h1 class="mt-5">Let's Get To The Point.</h1>
        <h3 class="mt-3 text-center">Reasons Why You'd Be Here:</h3>
        <h4 class="mt-2 text-center">For Enterprise/Business People:</h4>
        <p class="lead">For you professional business people, I know that your work as a manager is very difficult, so here let's get to the gist.
          click <a href="#">here</a> to go for what you came for. You have no time to mess around so here you go!
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-2 text-center">For Regular Internet Users:</h4>
        <p class="lead">Well let's start off with a good old welcome! If you are touring there website for kicks and giggles, I have to ask, why are you here?
          Like out of all the websites that you can visit, you chose this one to see?
          Honestly that is a honor and thank you for coming!
          My website is always under development, thus always changing!
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Since you are not here for business I doubt you will care much about what the 'Resume' section has to offer.
          What's there is just lot's of fancy words explaining who I am and what I do. If you want the simplistic answer, then you can click the 'About' page and have what you need!

        <h2 class="mt-3">For Enterprise People</h2>
        <p class="mt-3 lead">So, we don't really have anything for you fancy people,
          but if you want click <a href="port/portfolio.html">here</a> to go to my portfolio.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-3">For Regular Internet People</h2>
        <p class="lead mt-3 mb-5">I know this looks SUPER redundant, but like if you want,
          you can come to my blog <a href="blog/blog.html">here!</a>
          It's not going to be super interesting at first, but like maybe soon?
