        <p class="text-justify">
          Hello there!
          My Name's Brayan Quevedo Ramos,
          and i'm an aspiring Software/Web Developer!
          My passion is just making things.
          Not just any old thing like a sand castle,
          but I want to make programs that look very elegant,
          professional,
          and that have functionality in today's applications.
          Not just that,
          but can be modified to have long lasting impact
          on future generations!
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--My Passion/Left Side-->
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3 class="text-center">My Passion.</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          If you couldn't tell already,
          I love everything computers.
          I love development, and every aspect that is in it.
          <b><i>Anyone, anywhere, and anytime.</i></b>
          That is my motto for development
          since I believe it reflects me as a person!
          Development (especially web development)
          is such an easy language to just
          'grab and go' with.
          You can sit down one afternoon and
          learn the basics of HTML/CSS.
          Sure you won't be able to make high quality websites,
          but it's nice to have those basic skills, should something arise!
          I also reflect on this motto because of how I work.
          This may be good or bad but,
          I work in short bursts.
          So because of that, it can be while driving somewhere or
          being at Starbucks,
          I might just get a feeling of motivation and enthusiasm
          to develop something, or continue any of any existing projects.
          This may or may not be linked due to the caffeine,
          but non-the-less,
          I would still continue doing the work!  
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--General Info/Right Side-->
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3 class="text-center">General Information.</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Cool,
          I can make nice websites
          but besides that,
          who really 
          <b>AM I?</b>
          Besides the name provided,
          I do also do non-development related things!
          I'm currently working at a smoothie place down the street
          from where I live!
          I know that software development and web development
          is all fun, and stressful
          but I also like to contribute to other activities!
          For example,
          i'm a huge E-Sports fan!
          I'm #FNC (Fnatic)
          in every E-Sport in which
          they contribute to,
          especially League Of Legends
          and Counter Strike Global Offense.
          If we branch out of the tech bubble
          and things that every 15 year old does,
          I also love to just talk and interact with people.
          Sure,
          this sounds dumb,
          but let's really look into it!
          If you look around you,
          you can name at least 1 person who
          doesn't really like to talk.
          Studies have shown that the
          average teen spends 10 hours daily
          engaging on social media!*1
          That means that 10 hours a day is lost to
          texting, rather than speaking face to face.
          In my experience I love speaking face to face,
          because it's just something about the instant reaction,
          and something else that I just can't explain in words
          to tell you the difference.
          Does that mean that I still text 
          and use social media?
          <b>YES</b>
          I still do,
          probably still more than the average person
          but anytime the opportunity is presented
          to talk to the person face to face,
          rather than by phone
          even if it means walking a short distance!
