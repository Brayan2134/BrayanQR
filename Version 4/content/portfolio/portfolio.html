                        On this day,
                        I had the exciting opportunity
                        to visit the Garmin facility in Salem,
                        Oregon. <br>
                        The job shadow was on Software Engineering,
                        and the responsibilities that they have, work flow,
                        and anything that has to do with Software Engineering.
                        While I wish to become a Software/Web Developer,
                        it's great (in my opinion) to look at similar positions,
                        to see if there are better alternatives.
                        Long story, I don't wish to become a Software Engineer,
                        but I learned a lot from low level engineering in Assembly/C.

                            there was a food drive event that was going on.
                            The purpose of that food drive was to help families who could not afford food, have some.
                            I decided to grab some friends and help out. At the food drive, there were two stations.
                            Station one was unpacking and safety team.
                            This team was responsible for taking out food that was collected from the bags,
                            and making sure that they were not expired. Then there was our group.
                            Our group was responsible for placing the items in the correct categories
                            e.g - Soups, Vegetables, Fruits, Deserts etc. <br>

                        I was offered the opportunity to re-develop a website.
                        This website was a personal website, yet needed some assistance making the page more modern.
                        Since I did not have anything else on my agenda for the provided days,
                        I offered to redo the website.
                        This website was all made in Bootstrap V4 with no other assistance provided. <br>

                    I worked as a field worker,
                    doing various tasks,
                    to make sure that production/picking 
                    of the produce (grapes) went smoothly.
                    We accomplished this by moving the branches
                    of the plant,
                    pulling out the leaves at the appropriate time
                    and more! <br>
                    I was forced to exit the job,
                    as school was approaching and I only focus on
                    school during the school year.

                    As a position I couldn't really tell you,
                    since I kinda do a little bit of everything. 
                    I make smoothies,
                    i'm a cashier,

                    Since it's currently summer,
                    i'm working for a smoothie shop that sells
                    well... Smoothies.

                        I was given this job by a friend,
                        who knew somebody who wanted a website.
                        I agreed,
                        and I developed the website,
                        in which he directed.
                        He gave me a layout,
                        and color scheme that he wanted for the website,
                        and I followed it.
