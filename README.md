# Full-Personal-Website
This is a full personal website! This is not like my landing page.
My landing page was for quick contact, but that will soon be replaced with this website!
This is my online sypnosis!
It includes everything from contact information, to blog and everything in-between!

Version 1
The goal of version 1 is just to add everything on it.
All information and everything that a website would need shall be on this version.
Aesthetic comes last!
Shall be replaced by V2.

Version 2
The goal of version 2, is like adding CSS to HTML - i'm making it perfect!
I've added an entire design and method of how I want the website to look like!
Development shall be much slower than usual due to the fact that I really want to make this website look nice.
It shows what skills, as a developer, I contain.

Other:
I am keeping version 1 as a progress meter and to show how much i'm improving by!
I want to keep a record of my progress as I make this webpage look AWESOME!
