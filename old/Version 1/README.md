# Full-Personal-Website
Who is this website made by?
This website is made by me, Brayan Quevedo Ramos!
What is this website about?
This website is about me, and what I have to bring.
This can be anything personal to any business/enterprise empressions that may help me get a job in the future.
None of this code is paid to write, and all done on a voluntary basis!
I hope to make it a great site one day.
When is this website going to be up and running?
I'm honestly hoping that by the end of June I should have a running version of this website.
It's not going to be the best site in the world, but I believe that this is a good 'Benchmark' of what I as an individual am able to bring to the table.

Why should you care?
I don't know, but you may like what my skills are, in what areas I can improve.
If you are looking at this from the business perspective, it's that you can see what skills I have, what you need from a developer, and if I can provide the skills you need/exceed them, great-else, oh well then! I saved you time!
How am I making this website?
This answer is very simple. Bootstrap. I got a basic bootstrap templete that had a navbar.
From there, everything else is made by me!
